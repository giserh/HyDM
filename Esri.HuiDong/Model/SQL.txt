1.生成映射表

select sgm.MappID,OldFeatureType,StdID,OldCode
       ,wj.DM as NewCode,wj.TCMC as NewFeatureType,wj.BZ2 as MapMemo,wj.MC as YSMC,
      sgm.DWGEntityName,sgm.LWidth1000,sgm.LWidth500,sgm.XData,
      --sgm.ID as SGID,wj.ID as WJID,
      sgm.NewCode as SgCode,sgm.NewFeatureType as SgFeatureType,sgm.ysmc as SgYSMC
into WjMapping 
from sgmapping sgm ,wujiang wj,sgtowj
where sgm.id=sgtowj.sgid and wj.id=sgtowj.wjid




2.查看对比

select wj.DM as 吴江Code,wj.TCMC as 吴江Layer ,wj.MC as 吴江YSMC, wj.YSLX as 吴江类型 ,   
      sgm.NewCode as 韶关Code,sgm.NewFeatureType as 韶关Layer,sgm.ysmc as 韶关YSMC,sgm.NewGeomType as 韶关类型
from sgmapping sgm ,wujiang wj,sgtowj
where sgm.id=sgtowj.sgid and wj.id=sgtowj.wjid




3.未映射

select sgm.NewCode as 韶关Code,sgm.NewFeatureType as 韶关Layer,sgm.ysmc as 韶关YSMC,sgm.NewGeomType as 韶关类型
from sgmapping sgm 
where sgm.id in (select sgid  from sgtowj where wjid is null)
